This is a project to implement some of the things i learnt in a class i had this semester in the Computer Sciences Bachelors course.

It's main focus is to learn OOP concepts but it was a great opportunity to get more used to Visual Studio and Git.

More than that, i really enjoyed thinking of ways to generate random enities with random stats

I might not give this project more time because it was only a study. It has a special place in my heart tho.
